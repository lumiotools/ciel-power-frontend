            How it Works
          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Pearl Certification documents the steps you have taken towards
            making your home more energy-efficient. This certification can
            increase the overall value of your home for refinancing or sale.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
            With Pearl Certification, improving your home's performance means
            improving its value. A high-performing home is valuable to you â€“ but
            appraisers and future buyers can't "see" the value without the right
            documentation. We give you the tools to maximize your home's
            appraisal or price when the time comes to refinance or sell.

            The total number of points your home earns determines which level of
            Pearl Certification it achieves. Your home can earn Pearl
            Certification no matter when it was built if you have made the right
            improvements to it.
